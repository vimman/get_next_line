I know it's only time
Only time until
You pull the job that kills
You say you'll never do it again,
But you know you will
Call your boys who know the drill
It pains me to see how you get your thrill

Now time will prove
Now you have to choose
If life's the game you lose
By taking one last chance and falling to the gangsta blues...

I, I heard them people say
You're in high demand
Well, badness will follow badman...
You know you only do it son cause you know you can,
Another drive, another gram
Well think of your family, understand

Now time will prove
Now you have to choose
If life's the game you lose
By taking one last chance and falling...
You know it's true,
Life can be so cruel,
Time won't wait for you
And I don't want my friend a victim
Of the gangster blues...

Bad man and bad John from all bout
Rock it out
Me draw for me spliff not the cocaine, me lef it out
Babylon ah watch me run big tings from long time, time, time, ey yeah
Burning, hustling,
Smuggling, planting
Ah bare weed me deal wid and me nah touch, the hard ting
Soon done ya chattin when de war start fi happen right now.

Now time will prove
Now you have to choose
If life's the game you loose
By taking one last chance and falling to the gangsta blues...
